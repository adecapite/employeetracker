I've created a ZIP file for the video walkthrough of the employee tracker.

I will also be providing screenshots in the case that the video download will not work.

Starting the app by logging in with mysql information and then npm start will launch:

There you are able to view all employees by department or manager.

as well as add or remove employees from the database:
